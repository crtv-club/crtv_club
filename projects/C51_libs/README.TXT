Wow! It's even someone reading!
So...

Here some bunch of C51 libraries for work with peripherals and connectable sensors.
These libs are simplified and documented (I hope).
Libraries included (v0.1):
1) C51 Delay: based on Timer1, provide delay in miliseconds and microseconds;
2) C51 Software SPI: simple connection to an external device;
3) Seven-segment digit indicator: shows your numbers (and not only) on LED display;
4) Ultrasonic sensor: measure distance to the object - now you do not crash into the wall;
5) RC car control: Hmmm... just drive it!
6) NRF24L01+ connection: here is cool WiFi channels scanner, and... mmm... can anyone to make working other features? :)
7) Make your own ;)

NOTE: For some reason Keil uVision 4 for C51 is not support separated (*.c and *.h) libraries (maybe I something missed), 
so just include necessary *.h files to your project from this folder. But it's better to use libs from "Normal" folder.

DISCLAIMER: Libraries may contain errors, work-arounds and other crap - use them only as an example and rely on your mind.
